# Introduction

This is a readme on how to use the AI-control problem simulation tools in this project. The base for the algorithm is the Avida Artificial Life simulator (https://github.com/devosoft/avida), upon which we have made some modifications and additions.

# Prerequisites

MPI (message passing interface) is more or less required for efficient performance. The code is designed with OpenMPI.
There is also an OpenMP version available. It has more limitations and is usually not as efficient as the MPI version.

# Installation

After cloning this repo, follow the instructions on how to build Avida from the official Avida repo: https://github.com/devosoft/avida/blob/master/README
Note: The build will initially fail because no MPI compiler is set as standard. Therefore, when the build fails do the following steps:
1. find the path to your MPI compiler by typing "whereis mpic++"
2. go into the directory cbuild created in the build process
3. typ "ccmake ../"
4. typ "t" and find the line named CXX_COMPILER"
